## Overview
> The curriculum at 42 starts with the core curriculum. This experience sets the base for minimum skills, both human and technical. Following each studentâ€™s personal pace, it lasts a maximum of 18 months and lets students learn C programming, develop simple software using classic algorithms, discover access to the file system, and learn management of the UNIX process. It also includes a simple first approach to network architecture as well as system administration.
